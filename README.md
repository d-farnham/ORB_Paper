This repository provides all codes that accompany the paper: **_Regional intense precipitation events: robust inference from
credibly simulated GCM state variables_**

This code has been tested in **R** version version 3.3.3 **RStudio** version 1.0.136. The scripts' compatability with other versions is unknown.

Requirements: the following **R** packages (and any dependencies) are necessary and should be installed before attempting to
compile these codes: "akima", "dataRetrieval", "data.table", "dplyr", "ggmap", "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "locfit", "lubridate", "maps", "ncdf4", "readr", "reshape2", "tidyr".

There are two main scripts:

1. **ORB_1_LoadProcessSaveData.R**: This script processes the data in the project folder **Raw_Data** and saves the relevant outputs to the project folder **Processed_Data**.

2. **ORB_2_PaperFigs&Stats.R**: this script creates all of the paperâ€™s figures and computes other statistics reported in the paper. Often these statistical outputs are embedded in the script as comments.

The scripts in the project folder **R** folder are functions that are sourced in **ORB_1_LoadProcessSaveData.R** and **ORB_2_PaperFigs&Stats.R**
